                    Hi! I'm Anthony LaFleur, but you can call me Tony. I'm a mid-twenties software developer originally from Massachusetts, currently living in New York. I started programming in 7th grade and have been spending as much of my free time as possible learning new and innovative programming techniques. I mainly focus in web design and development but have a strong interest in game design and development as well. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I officially started my programming career at Westfield Technical Academy, where I attended an Information Technology technical program. During my time at WTA, I focused largely in programming and software development. After High School, I took a break from school to explore the North East and find myself a bit. I'm now enrolled at Champlain College in Burlington, VT for Web Design and Development as a fulltime student.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm hoping to move into a career with web design and development, especially if focused in the video game industy. I want to work with other creatives to make beautiful, intuitive interfaces and expierences!
