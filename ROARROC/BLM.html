                Dr. Martin Luther King Jr once state life's most persistent and urgent question is, <br><br><b>"What are you doing for others?"</b><br><br>The entire premise of the opening of ROAR was to fill a void that we had in our community and create a safe space for everyone. Though we had only been open 4 months before covid struck our community and we were ordered to shut down, we felt well on our way to accomplishing our mission. The ROAR Team is made up of diverse individuals that love what we do. Every one of our staff members believes in making ROAR a safe and inviting place for our entire community.<br><br>And though we are a diverse team, no one person's journey is the same as someone else's and to even begin to understand the personal pain felt by members of our community without experiencing it ourselves would be nothing more than pandering and grandstanding. In the day of social media, using the wrong words at time can almost seem worse than saying nothing at all, but that's not a reason to remain silent. We stand by and support those that want and need to have their voices heard. We stand by and support those standing up for change.<br><br>Though there is much work to be done, we all share common expierences and joy in part to the generations that came before us. We can't rest there -from discrimination in the face of trans people, black people, gays, lesbians, and everything between. We must appreciate those that got us here but we owe it to our future generations the same amount of passion, vigor, and resistance so that they too can be proud of us.<br><br><b>ROAR<br>#BlackLivesMatter</b>
